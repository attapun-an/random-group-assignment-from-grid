# random-group-assignment-from-grid
random group assignment from grid (row, col) input
Method. Place your samples into a grid and input the amount of rows and collumns (I don't think it works if the collumns and rows are not full). Then change the text in the code the numbe of each. 
Change the number of groups you would like to create.

The program will return which co-ordinates have been assigned by each group
